# ![Assessment 2][banner]

This repository is a fork for [**assessment 2**][a2] of [frontend 3][fe3]
at [**@CMDA**][cmda].

### Recourses
Data set used: [Deaths; underlying cause of death (shortlist), sex, age][DataSet]

Chart used as inspiration/example: [Sankey Diagram][Chart]

### The choice
Unlike last time this time we had to choose a dataset out of a large collection of choices. This meant that I had to look better at the data which I wanted to use. This is what I should have done better with the first assessment so now I was forced to look better at what I was choosing.

This not only helpt me with choosing the dataset but also give me an idea as to what sort of way I needed to show the data in. With this knowledge finding a graph or in my case a diagram was quite easy. I new I could sort the data per year and with that show how many deaths there where per cause.

### Interaction
Because there is a lot of data that is overlapping in the diagram I thought it would be useful to add a tooltip to show the specific data the user was hovering over.
